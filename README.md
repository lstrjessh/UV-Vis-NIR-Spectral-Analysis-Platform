# Spectral Analysis Platform

A comprehensive web-based application for spectroscopic data analysis and machine learning model calibration. Developed as a complimentary tool for camera-based single-beam transmission grating spectrophotometry, this platform provides advanced tools for absorbance calculation, model training, and concentration prediction.

## Features

### ðŸ”¬ Core Analysis Tools
- **Calculate Absorbance** - Process raw spectral data with dark spectrum correction, averaging, and advanced smoothing algorithms
- **Model Calibration** - Build and optimize ML models with multiple algorithms including:
  - Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Networks (PyTorch-based)
- **Predict Concentration** - Apply trained models to predict analyte concentrations with batch processing support
- **Provide Feedback** - Submit feedback and suggestions to improve the platform

### ðŸš€ Advanced Features
- **Automated Hyperparameter Optimization** - Uses Optuna for intelligent parameter tuning
- **Cross-Validation** - Built-in k-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Plotly-based charts for data exploration and model analysis
- **Model Persistence** - Save and load trained models with joblib serialization
- **Peak Detection** - Automated spectral peak identification and analysis
- **Data Preprocessing** - Comprehensive data cleaning and normalization tools
