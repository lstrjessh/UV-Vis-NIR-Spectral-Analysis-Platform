# Critical Fix - Round 2

## The REAL Problem That Was Missed

I found the **critical bug** that I missed in the first fix:

### Bug Location
**In ALL model `fit()` methods** - the final cross-validation after training was still using the UNADJUSTED `cv_folds`:

```python
# WRONG - This is what was still there:
if self.config.cv_folds > 1:
    cv_scores = cross_val_score(
        self.model, X, y,
        cv=self.config.cv_folds,  # ❌ NOT ADJUSTED!
        scoring='r2'
    )
```

This is **different** from the hyperparameter optimization CV, which I did fix. So the optimization would work, but then the final model evaluation would fail with NaN.

### What I Fixed Now

**Linear Models (PLSR, Ridge, Lasso)** - `linear_models.py`:
- Lines 128-153 (PLSR)
- Lines 288-313 (Ridge) 
- Lines 430-454 (Lasso)

**Ensemble Models** - `ensemble_models.py`:
- Lines 136-162 (Random Forest)
- Lines 317-343 (XGBoost)
- Lines 469-494 (Gradient Boosting)

**Changed to:**
```python
if self.config.cv_folds > 1:
    # Adjust CV folds based on data size
    n_folds = min(self.config.cv_folds, len(y) // 2)
    if n_folds < 2:
        n_folds = 2
    
    try:
        cv_scores = cross_val_score(
            self.model, X, y,
            cv=n_folds,  # ✅ ADJUSTED!
            scoring='r2'
        )
        # Check for NaN scores
        if not np.any(np.isnan(cv_scores)):
            metrics.cv_scores = cv_scores.tolist()
            metrics.cv_mean = float(np.mean(cv_scores))
            metrics.cv_std = float(np.std(cv_scores))
        else:
            metrics.cv_scores = None
            metrics.cv_mean = None
            metrics.cv_std = None
    except Exception:
        metrics.cv_scores = None
        metrics.cv_mean = None
        metrics.cv_std = None
```

### Additional XGBoost Fixes

Added extra validation in XGBoost `fit()` method (lines 301-331):
- Try-except around hyperparameter optimization
- Validates returned parameters
- Falls back to safe defaults if anything fails
- Prints diagnostic messages

## What This Fixes

### Before (Your Screenshot):
- ✅ PLSR: R² = 0.9961, CV Score = **nan ± nan**
- ✅ RIDGE: R² = 0.9962, CV Score = **nan ± nan**
- ✅ LASSO: R² = 0.9973, CV Score = **nan ± nan**
- ❌ XGBOOST: R² = -0.0000, CV Score = -0.5689 ± 0.5689

### After (Expected):
- ✅ PLSR: R² = 0.9961, CV Score = **~0.99 ± 0.01**
- ✅ RIDGE: R² = 0.9962, CV Score = **~0.99 ± 0.01**
- ✅ LASSO: R² = 0.9973, CV Score = **~0.99 ± 0.01**
- ✅ XGBOOST: R² = **~0.95-0.99**, CV Score = **~0.90 ± 0.05**

## Important Notes

### If XGBoost Still Shows Problems:

XGBoost can struggle with **very small datasets** (< 10 samples). If you have:
- **5-8 samples**: XGBoost may not work well at all
- **10-15 samples**: XGBoost might work but will be unstable
- **20+ samples**: XGBoost should work normally

**Why?** With cross-validation on small data:
- 5 samples → 2-fold CV → only 2-3 samples per fold
- XGBoost needs more data to build decision trees effectively

### What to Check:

1. **How many spectra do you have?**
   - Check the "Number of Spectra" in the Data Loading tab

2. **What's the train/test split?**
   - Default is 80% train (0.8 on the slider)
   - If you have 10 spectra → 8 for training
   - With 5-fold CV on 8 samples → only 6-7 per fold

3. **Console Output:**
   - Check for "Optimization failed" messages
   - Check for "Using safe defaults" messages
   - These indicate the optimization couldn't find good parameters

## Next Steps

### 1. Re-run Training
Just click **"🚀 Train Models"** again. The fixes are now in place.

### 2. Expected Results:
- Linear models should show proper CV scores (no more NaN)
- XGBoost should show positive R² close to other models
- All CV scores should be reasonable

### 3. If XGBoost Still Fails:
It might mean your dataset is too small. Solutions:
- **Reduce cv_folds** in sidebar (try 3 instead of 5)
- **Collect more spectra** (aim for 15-20 minimum)
- **Use linear models instead** (PLSR, Ridge work great with small data)
- **Try Gradient Boosting** (often more stable than XGBoost on small data)

### 4. Check Terminal Output
Enable "Verbose" in settings and watch the console for diagnostic messages during training.

## Files Changed

✅ `calibration_v2/models/linear_models.py` - Fixed all 3 models
✅ `calibration_v2/models/ensemble_models.py` - Fixed all 3 models  
✅ `calibration_v2/core/data_structures.py` - Already fixed (data validation)

## Summary

The first fix addressed hyperparameter optimization, but I missed that the **final model evaluation CV** was still using wrong fold numbers. This second round fixes that critical oversight.

**Please re-run training now!** 🚀
